# Vet Clinic Database

## Description

> "Vet Clinic Database" is a project where I use a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic that includes a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](https://github.com/cynthiainga/vet_clinic_database/blob/develop/schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](https://github.com/cynthiainga/vet_clinic_database/blob/develop/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](https://github.com/cynthiainga/vet_clinic_database/blob/develop/queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.

This project is build with:
